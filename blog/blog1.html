      <h1>Limitations and drawbacks of employing website builders.</h1>
      <p>When it comes to building a website, website builders are often considered as a quick and easy solution. Website builders allow users to create websites with little or no coding experience, which makes them appealing to individuals and small businesses who need a website but lack the resources to hire a professional web developer.</p>
      <p>However, while website builders may seem like an ideal solution, they have their limitations and drawbacks. In this article, weâ€™ll take a look at some of the limitations and drawbacks of employing website builders.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Limited customization options</li>
        <p>One of the biggest limitations of using a website builder is the limited customization options available. Website builders often offer a limited set of templates and design options, which can result in a lack of uniqueness and creativity. This can be particularly frustrating for businesses that want to create a unique online presence that stands out from the competition.</p>
        <li>Limited functionality</li>
        <p>Another limitation of website builders is the limited functionality they offer. While website builders often include basic features such as contact forms and social media integration, they may lack more advanced features such as e-commerce functionality or complex database integration. This can be a problem for businesses that require more advanced features to meet their needs.</p>
        <li>Limited control over SEO</li>
        <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is essential for any website, as it helps to improve search engine rankings and increase visibility. However, website builders often offer limited control over SEO, which can make it difficult to optimize a website for search engines. This can result in a lower search engine ranking and less visibility for the website.</p>
        <li>Limited scalability</li>
        <p>Finally, website builders can be limiting when it comes to scalability. While website builders may be suitable for small businesses and individuals, they may not be suitable for larger businesses that require more complex websites with a greater level of functionality. In addition, website builders may be limited in terms of the number of pages and content they can support, which can be a problem for businesses that need to expand their website over time.</p>
      </ol>
      <p>In conclusion, while website builders may seem like an ideal solution for those who need a website quickly and without much effort, they have their limitations and drawbacks. Before deciding to use a website builder, it is important to carefully consider your business needs and objectives to determine whether a website builder is the best solution for your needs.</p>
